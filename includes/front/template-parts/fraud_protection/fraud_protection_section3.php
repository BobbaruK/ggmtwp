        <h2>Certification Verification</h2>
        <p>Sadly, certification forgery is a real problem. This is why we do not just accept any documents at face value. We personally test everything that we use to verify it is of the required quality that you expect. Only when we have checked, rechecked, and checked again do we move forward.</p>
