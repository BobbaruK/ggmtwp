        <h2>Pure Simplicity</h2>
        <p>While sourcing from China is indeed a fantastic way to grow your business, it is easy to overlook the practical difficulties involved.  Things like time zones, cultural and linguistic differences, and legal regulations can easy overwhelm even the savviest of business owners.  Let GGMT do the hard work for you! You don’t need to deal with four or five different companies for raw materials, refining, manufacturing, shipping, etc – you deal only with GGMT and leave the rest to us.</p>
