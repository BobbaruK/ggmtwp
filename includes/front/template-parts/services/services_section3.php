        <h2>We take a multi-pronged approach to quality assurance:</h2>
        <h6>Pre-Production Materials Verification</h6>
        <p>A supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link and the raw materials are the single most important decision with regards to quality.  Our agents and lab technicians accompany the manufacturers on every materials purchase to guarantee that they conform to you precise specifications.  We test all materials in our own labs to verify everything before we move forward.</p>
        <h6>Continuous Oversight</h6>
        <p>We are a leading expert in the inspection and testing fields.  Our team oversees and continuously tests your order at every step to ensure that you never have to sacrifice on quality. Every item we ship meets all required standards.</p>
        <h6>Shipping Done Right</h6>
        <p>All the testing in the world doesn't matter if your package is lost or damaged before reaching you.  Which is why we extend our same commitment to quality to this final, vital step.  Every package is neatly and securely packed to ensure that it arrives exactly as it left - and reaches you ready to be put to use.  Our team of customs agents ensure that every item is properly labelled and matched to prevent any delays on your order.</p>
        <h6>Triple Checked</h6>
        <p>Before sending anything there is a final round of tests to ensure that everything meets all:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Local, national, and international regulations</li>
          <li>Import & export requirements </li>
          <li>Your exact specifics</li>
        </ul>
        <h6>Long-Term Solutions</h6>
        <p class="m-0">We value your business and are committed to maintaining a happy and healthy relationship.  Our local agents are always available to assist you with anything at any time of the day.  We know your company and your needs and offer long-term supply chain solutions.</p>
