        <h2>About Head Covers</h2>
        <p class="m-0">One of the most in-demand items, head covers represent an essential part of any infection control strategy.  Head covers are made from lightweight, breathable materials to ensure comfort for the wearer over extended use sessions. Like gowns, head covers are rated according to AAMI, in addition they are made in conjunction with AORN guidelines to ensure total coverage of the head, neck, and sideburns.</p>
